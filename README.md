# ServerSync
ServerSync allows you to sync data from your supported plugins across all of your BungeeCord servers using their built in API's - ensuring data is always in sync and never corrupted. ServerSync approaches syncing data across your Bungeecord servers in a unique way. In the past, you would have to share a MySQL or SQLite file, or copy whole files across servers every so often. This is extremely dangerous as the files can become corrupt. ServerSync uses the built in API's from plugins to sync data across servers using Bungeecord's messaging system

# Plugin Information
